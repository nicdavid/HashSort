    "Sorting strings is O(n) time.\n",

    "length of the string is going to be a relatively low number, the length\n",
    "of the string will not cause the asymtotic behavior to change.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Overview:\n",
    "This implementation of the hash table is what allows for the\n",
    "sorting to occur. I have created my own version of a hash table\n",
    "because hash tables are implemented as dictionaries in Python.\n",
    "This does not allow for the sorting effect that I am able to\n",
    "acheive using this implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "When created, the hash table creates a table (an array) of \n",
    "a specified size. This table is initialized with the value\n",
    "None in all of the positions. I also initialize the length\n",
    "of the table here.\n",
    "\n",
    "The width refers to how many characters will be sorted through\n",
    "when sorting string values. The larger this number becomes, the\n",
    "more space that is required by the hash table. Smaller width's\n",
    "will utilize less space, but will not gaurantee that the array \n",
    "will be sorted fully.\n",
    "\n",
    "The getSize function computes the sum of values from 1 to k where\n",
    "k is the number of characters to be sorted on. This is a sum because\n",
    "we will need the space for any length of string from 1 to k. For\n",
    "example, if k were 2, we would need 26^1 spaces to represent the \n",
    "26 one character strings as well as 26^2 to represent the 676\n",
    "two character strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hash function that is currently implemented is fairly rudimentary.\n",
    "For integers, it will return the integer as the hashed value. For strings,\n",
    "the hashed value returns the numerical value of each of the characters which\n",
    "are weighted by the position that it exists in the string and by the iteration\n",
    "count. This ensures that strings are sorted according to their alphabetical \n",
    "ordering. Any hash function can be used as long as it returns an integer value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The append function will take in the value to be appended and will hash it.\n",
    "Once hashed, the hashed value is checked in the hash table. If a list does not\n",
    "yet exist in this location, one is created. Once created, the value is added \n",
    "to the list. If a hashed value falls outside of the bounds of the array, it\n",
    "will place it in the list on the end of the hash table. For example, if the \n",
    "largest value in the hash table is n and a hashed value turns out to be n+2,\n",
    "that value will be placed in the list for n. This means that ends of the list\n",
    "will not be sorted, but the algorithm may be rerun on the beginning and ends\n",
    "of the hash table to ensure total sorting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The getValues function allows the program to pull the sorted values from the\n",
    "hash table as an array. Since the hash table will likely be very sparse for\n",
    "a small or an undiverse input, there will be many 'None' values in the table.\n",
    "This will remove the 'None' values, ensure that all values are out of the \n",
    "collision lists, and relinquishes the need to hold the large amount of space\n",
    "that the hash table takes up. In this scenario, the space the hash table uses\n",
    "is not freed, but I can envision that it may be in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "The len and str functions provide methods for determining length and converting\n",
    "the structure into string form respectively. These methods are used when the\n",
    "built in len() and print() functions are called respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Integer Drawbacks:\n",
    "There are a couple fallbacks here. The first being that the\n",
    "integer values that are being sorted may not have a range from \n",
    "0 to n where n is the max number of array slots. This is an issue \n",
    "that can be addressed in a couple different ways. The first being\n",
    "that a larger array may be used. This seems like a waste of memory,\n",
    "but is one possibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next solution that will mitigate space waste is to run through \n",
    "the list and find bounds. If for instance, the lowest value that \n",
    "needs to be sorted is 1000, we can pretend that the 0 value of the \n",
    "table is where 1000 should be placed. This allows for an extra 1000\n",
    "values (n+1000 values) to be represented in the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next issue that I face with this implementation when sorting \n",
    "integers is the range of values that can be sorted. For example, \n",
    "if the values to be sorted range from 0-n, but there are only n/2\n",
    "spots in the array (representing values 0-n/2), values in the upper\n",
    "n/2 range will not be placed in the table. This will result in a \n",
    "null pointer exception because the array slot does not exist. I am\n",
    "currently addressing this issue by simply appending values that appear \n",
    "outside of the range (0-n/2) to the end of the list contained in the \n",
    "n/2th table slot. This leads to a lack of sorting for the entirety of\n",
    "the unsorted items. This can then be addressed using the strategy in \n",
    "the previous paragraph. You are able to take the values in table slot\n",
    "n/2 and run the hash sort algorithm on that individual slot. The lower \n",
    "bound of the array can be set to n/2 and now the second iteration of the\n",
    "hash sort will run on the values that were not sorted in the first run.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "String Drawbacks:\n",
    "Strings are sortable in O(n) using this implementation. The drawbacks\n",
    "are that for large enough unsorted data samples, there is a low granularity\n",
    "for the sorted values. By this, I mean that there is a tradeoff between\n",
    "table size and how many characters can be sorted. For example, to sort strings\n",
    "based on the first four characters, you must have an array of 26^4 size.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this issue, a similar strategy can be applied as in the integer\n",
    "cases. After the first run through, strings should be sorted roughly based \n",
    "on the  first k characters. Once the strings are sorted in this degree, you \n",
    "may then run the hash sort algorithm on buckets of n/2 size. This will allow\n",
    "you to increase the number of characters (the width) that are being used \n",
    "when sorting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another performance increase to this process is by setting the bounds of the\n",
    "hash table. After the first iteration has run, we know that the first k characters\n",
    "of every word have been sorted. This means that we can set the 0th position in\n",
    "the table to account for the fact that we don't need to sort by those characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although this approach to sorting does not sort every word properly in the first\n",
    "run, it should still take O(n) time. The buckets that are used when fully sorting\n",
    "are dependent on how much memory one is willing to utilize as well as the length\n",
    "of the words. I have not worked out the exact math here, but I do not believe \n",
    "this will cause it to approach O(nlgn) time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Other Drawbacks:\n",
    "I have not tested this method with anything other than positive integers. I \n",
    "believe that with this strategy, it is possible to develop a hash function\n",
    "for any other scenario to make this sorting method work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Large files that cannot be read into memory may also prove to have issues.\n",
    "I anticipate that for a large enough data source, the strategies provided\n",
    "above will not work. I am certain that there is possibility for a workaround\n",
    "using physical storage. By this I mean one can treat a portion of physical \n",
    "memory as the hash table. You are able to read a portion of the large file\n",
    "into memory and then sort it and then read the whole bucket back into physical\n",
    "memory. This strategy could allow for a much larger hash table as physical \n",
    "memory is much larger and removes space constraints. This will allow for \n",
    "the large file to be sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Updates:\n",
    "Hash sort sorts values once into a hash table and then when the user\n",
    "calls getValues() the lists will be sorted using insertion sort. According\n",
    "to bucket sort, this should maintain O(n) for the average time complexity.\n",
    "For integers, values will potentially overwhelmingly fall outside of the \n",
    "hash table range (0 - 26^6), so there may be many values in the 26^6-1 table\n",
    "slot. This may be addressed by running through the values and computing\n",
    "a range and then using a range to find bounds for the hash table. By this,\n",
    "I mean that you can offset the array to be able to encompass more values in\n",
    "the table, so the table isn't overwhelmingly skewed to one side.\n",
